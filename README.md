## Introduction
This is a code repository for the corresponding [video tutorial](https://youtu.be/khJlrj3Y6Ls). 

I followed along a video tutorial and created a full COVID-19 Tracker. I used and learnt React, Charts.JS and Material UI.

I have got a strong understanding of React's workflow and the use of hooks.

API used: https://covid19.mathdro.id/api

Setup:
- run ```npm i && npm start```
